  <img src="assets/images/KeenWilson_ProfilePicture.jpg">
  <p>Keen started to code and became a fresh web developer after she led a cross-functional team on projects that involved Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Social Media Marketing in her previous role as an account manager (aka a problem solver) at J. Walter Thompson in Bangkok, Thailand.

    She decided to deepen her technical knowledge by attending the KU Coding Bootcamp at the University of Kansas, and make her love for programming into a career.
    
    Keen holds an MBA with an emphasis on Marketing from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where turned her into a fan of North Carolina Tar Heels menâ€™s basketball.
    
    Fun Facts: When she's not coding, Keen enjoys baking cookies and playing Lego blocks with her daughters.</p>
